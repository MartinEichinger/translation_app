# Translation App

## Development Practice Challenge : Build a Language Translation App

**Small** web application for the translation of texts from one language into another language.
The Google Translator API is used for this function. To add required CORS headers cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com is used, which has restricted calls per hour.

**The** application consists of the following files

- index.html: HTML page with all static content
- index.js: JavaScript file for input processing and REST API.

**Application** can be used by simply starting the index.html page in a browser.

**The** source language is German. The target language is English.
